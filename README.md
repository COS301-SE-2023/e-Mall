## Project Description

E-mall is an online platform that allows verified sellers to list their products and enables customers to easily view and compare similar products across multiple websites. By scraping verified seller websites, E-mall ensures that only high-quality products are displayed to customers, and customers can receive personalized experiences based on their search history. Sellers can benefit from the platform by receiving analytics on customer behavior, while customers can view competitor prices on a given product, enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions. E-mall aims to offer hassle-free shopping and selling experiences to customers and sellers, respectively.

## Project Methodology

The software development process will be managed by our development team using the Agile approach. This strategy places a focus on cooperation, adaptability, and ongoing improvement to make sure the software satisfies our clients' demands.

Key features of our Agile approach during this project include:

- Regular two-week sprints: Our team will work in fortnightly sprints to deliver working and usable software in small increments

- Continuous Testing: We will test software throughout the development process to address any issues as early as possible

- Consistent Communication: We have established a regular meeting schedule, our team will meet fortnightly to discuss project progress and address any issues or concerns. In addition, we will have a weekly mentor meeting to receive guidance and support. Communication between team roles will be ongoing and frequent to ensure that everyone is aligned and working together effectively.
